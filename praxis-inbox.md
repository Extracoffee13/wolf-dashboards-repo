# PRAXIS Inbox

~~~
PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity is zero — both inbox files were missing and had to be initialized; no agent has written a packet yet.
outcome: All agents (AP, Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) are currently quiet; AP is the only active contributor via this bootstrap block.
lesson: The inbox files must exist in the repo before any agent can contribute; always seed them on first deploy so the local watcher has a valid target.

PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: construct-standup
decision: ran end-of-day standup synthesis across all active agents
outcome: Zero agent activity found; repo silent since 2026-06-24, so the standup reported an empty day
lesson: The capture channel itself looks dead (no inbox writes, no promotions, no reviews since May); routines reading it report "quiet" identically to a healthy quiet day, so pipeline liveness must be checked separately.
