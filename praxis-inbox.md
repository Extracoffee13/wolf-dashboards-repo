# PRAXIS Inbox

~~~
PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity is zero — both inbox files were missing and had to be initialized; no agent has written a packet yet.
outcome: All agents (AP, Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) are currently quiet; AP is the only active contributor via this bootstrap block.
lesson: The inbox files must exist in the repo before any agent can contribute; always seed them on first deploy so the local watcher has a valid target.

PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity remains minimal at 1 packet over ~15 days; the pipeline is initialized but no agent other than AP has contributed, and the sole prior block has drifted unprocessed since the 2026-05-01 review.
outcome: AP is the only active contributor; all 18 other agents (Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) remain silent.
lesson: Each daily review cycle must move processed blocks from praxis-inbox.md to praxis-inbox-processed.md and include timestamps in blocks so drift can be detected automatically.
