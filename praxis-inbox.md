# PRAXIS Inbox

~~~
PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity is zero — both inbox files were missing and had to be initialized; no agent has written a packet yet.
outcome: All agents (AP, Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) are currently quiet; AP is the only active contributor via this bootstrap block.
lesson: The inbox files must exist in the repo before any agent can contribute; always seed them on first deploy so the local watcher has a valid target.

PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: skill-discovery
decision: scanned mcp.directory + github + npm + pypi + anthropic news
outcome: 3 candidates found scoring >=3, top one was Claude Code mods
lesson: In this cycle new tooling surfaced mainly via npm and Anthropic's own product blog; mcp.directory and PyPI were unreachable from the sandbox, so coverage there is blind.
