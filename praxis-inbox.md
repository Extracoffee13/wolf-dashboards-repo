# PRAXIS Inbox

~~~
PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity is zero — both inbox files were missing and had to be initialized; no agent has written a packet yet.
outcome: All agents (AP, Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) are currently quiet; AP is the only active contributor via this bootstrap block.
lesson: The inbox files must exist in the repo before any agent can contribute; always seed them on first deploy so the local watcher has a valid target.

PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: skill-discovery
decision: scanned mcp.directory + github + npm + pypi + anthropic news
outcome: 5 candidates found scoring >=3, top one was ruflo (multi-agent meta-harness for Claude, 314 MCP tools, 57.4k stars, updated June 2 2026)
lesson: The highest-signal new skills are emerging from the GitHub mcp-server topic sorted by recent activity — npm/pypi lag by weeks, while GitHub reflects same-day releases; filter by star velocity, not just recency
