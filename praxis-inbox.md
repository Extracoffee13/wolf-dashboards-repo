# PRAXIS Inbox

~~~
PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity is zero — both inbox files were missing and had to be initialized; no agent has written a packet yet.
outcome: All agents (AP, Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) are currently quiet; AP is the only active contributor via this bootstrap block.
lesson: The inbox files must exist in the repo before any agent can contribute; always seed them on first deploy so the local watcher has a valid target.

PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity is still zero — the only packet in the inbox is the same AP bootstrap block from 2026-06-23, now 41 days unprocessed with no new contributions from any agent.
outcome: AP remains the sole contributor; all other agents (Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) are quiet with no packets logged since the pipeline's inception.
lesson: A pending block sitting unprocessed for 41+ days signals the local watcher isn't consuming commits — verify it's running and pointed at this branch before expecting agents to adopt the PRAXIS_INBOX format.
