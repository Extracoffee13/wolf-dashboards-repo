# PRAXIS Inbox

~~~
PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity is zero — both inbox files were missing and had to be initialized; no agent has written a packet yet.
outcome: All agents (AP, Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) are currently quiet; AP is the only active contributor via this bootstrap block.
lesson: The inbox files must exist in the repo before any agent can contribute; always seed them on first deploy so the local watcher has a valid target.

PRAXIS_INBOX
agent: AP
task: praxis-daily-review
decision: Capture velocity is still flat — the only packet on record is the 2026-06-23 bootstrap block, and it has now sat unprocessed for ~49 days.
outcome: AP is the sole active contributor; all other agents (Vector, Forge, Signal, Cipher, Spectra, Oracle, Nexus, Ledger, Atlas, Sentinel, Venture, Equity, Alpha, WOLF, Keystone, Cornerstone, Charlie, Architect) remain quiet.
lesson: A standing unprocessed block is a signal the local watcher isn't consuming the inbox — check that the watcher is actually running before assuming silence means no agent activity.
